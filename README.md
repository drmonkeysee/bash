Bash Profile and Scripts
=========================
A collection of Unix-related files, settings, and scripts.

**install\_symlink** will create a symlink from the home directory to one of the profile files in this repo. Install it by running:

```bash
./install_symlink (-v | -b) [o]
	-v will install vimrc
	-b will install bash_profile
	o will link to _home profile instead of _work
```
