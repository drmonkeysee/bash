Bash Profile and Scripts
=========================
A collection of bash-related files and scripts I've found useful.

**install\_symlink.sh** will create a symlink from the home directory to one of the profile files in this repo. You can run it by typing:

    bash install_symlink.sh (-v | -b) [-o]
        -v will install vimrc
        -b will install bash_profile
        -o will link to _home profile instead of _work
